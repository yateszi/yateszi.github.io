I am a IC designer.
after work for years, i have some no big tips to share.

1. get fimilar with a code editor(gvim for example), this will help your coding efficient.
2. be good at basic version control software like `SVN`. no man can beat the world, we need a team to work-together.
3. be open to embrace new technologies. as some said`"we need to work smarter , not harder"`
4. the coding language we used is called HDL(Dardware Discription Language). so do the design in your head first, then discripe it with a RTL coding.
